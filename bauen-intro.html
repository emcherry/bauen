					<p>Hello supplier,<br/>
					Introducing Bauen Group - 1st February 2017<br/>

					</p>
					
					<p>Each of these entities will continue to trade individually under their current names, ABN's and accounts however Bauen Group will manage accounts payable from the 1st February 2017.<br/></p>
					
					<p>Where Bauen Group intends to take over contracts on behalf of all entities - usually when your services or products or contracts are used by more than one entity - we will separately contact you to update our account details and reapply for accounts in the new entity name.<br/></p>
 
					<p>However - all invoices should still be made out to the entity which holds your account, simply update the Billing Contact Information for the entity.<br/></p>
 
					<p>For all invoicing from the 1st February please send your invoices and statements to:<br/>
					<a href="accounts@bauengroup.com.au">accounts@bauengroup.com.au</a>.<br/></p>  
 
					<p>We are also changing our purchasing procedures:<br/> 
					All purchases in excess of $300, by any entity, must have a Purchase Order issued by <a href="accounts@bauengroup.com.au">accounts@bauengroup.com.au</a><br/>
					</p>
					
					<p>Ensure the Purchase Order is listed on your invoice<br/></p>
					
					<p>Any instalment plans or monthly payments that total in excess of $300 also require a purchase order<br/></p>
 
					<p>The existing entity email addresses you may currently be using will initially be redirected for at least a month and then shut down.<br/></p>  
 
					<p>If you have any queries please direct them in the first instance to <a href="christina@bauengroup.com.au">christina@bauengroup.com.au</a>.  Christina Welsford is your primary contact now for Accounts Payable enquiries.<br/></p>

					<p>Kind regards,<br/><br/>
					Paul and Suzanne Commerford
